# Build Your Own Agent: Copilot Studio in a Day

Repository to store all assets for the **Build Your Own Agent: Copilot Studio in a Day** workshop, first delivered as part of the [European SharePoint Conference (ESPC) 2025](https://www.sharepointeurope.com/).

## Abstract

With the recent innovations implemented as part of Microsoft Copilot Studio (formerly known as Power Virtual Agents), it’s now easier than ever to extend the native Copilot experiences in new and interesting ways, address niche business requirements, and deliver further value from your Copilot investments.

In addition, thanks in part to the incorporation of agentic capabilities across both Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry, we can build genuinely autonomous agents that can accomplish various business tasks without breaking a sweat.

Join us for this all-day workshop, designed to show you how easy it is to create your own custom Agent for the very first time.

Attendees will see how easy it is to leverage Microsoft Copilot Studio to create an Agent, incorporate topics and custom actions, and deploy an Agent across the organisation.

Whether you are a seasoned Power Platform / Microsoft 365 professional or just starting your journey, this workshop is for you!

### Key Takeaways
